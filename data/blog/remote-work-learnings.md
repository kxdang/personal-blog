# Lessons From 6 Years of Remote Work: My Journey and What I‚Äôve Learned

Looking back, I feel incredibly grateful that my career shifted toward remote work when it did. Before that, I was commuting from Mississauga to North York every morning for a co-op job. The traffic alone was enough to drain me before the workday even began, and then again on the drive home.

Sometimes, just to decompress and to avoid the worst of rush hour, I‚Äôd swing by my friend‚Äôs dad‚Äôs auto shop near work. I‚Äôd hang out, learn a bit about cars, and wait until the roads cleared so I could get home faster. It made my trusty 2004 CR-V shine, but the whole routine still left me burned out.

Fast forward six years, and remote work has not only changed how I approach my job but also how I manage my environment, my focus, and my energy. Here are the biggest lessons I‚Äôve learned about staying productive and sane while working from home.

## 1. Create a Dedicated Space for Work

Early on, my biggest mistake was using the same space for work and play. I‚Äôd wrap up a long day and still feel like I was "at work" while gaming or relaxing. Now, I keep my workspace completely separate from where I rest or unwind. That physical distinction makes it so much easier to mentally clock out.

**What helped me most:**

- Investing in a **standing desk**
- Using a **separate ergonomic chair** strictly for work
- Keeping my workspace clean and free of distractions

## 2. Prioritize Ergonomics

After sitting for eight hours a day, you quickly learn that a cheap chair isn‚Äôt cutting it. During the pandemic, I upgraded to two top-tier ergonomic chairs: the **Herman Miller Aeron** and the **Steelcase Leap V2**. My partner uses one now, and we swap depending on the season. The Leap is my go-to most of the year, but the Aeron‚Äôs mesh back is perfect during the summer.

## 3. Light Your Workspace Like a Studio

Good lighting does more than make your setup look great. It improves your focus and even your presence on video calls. I spent hours learning about proper lighting on YouTube, and it paid off.

When your webcam picks up a clear, well-lit image without harsh shadows, it makes virtual interactions more natural. It‚Äôs a small detail, but it creates a better experience for everyone in the meeting.

## 4. Take Audio Seriously

Audio might be the most underrated part of remote work. Nobody wants to sit through a call straining to hear you or distracted by background noise. I eventually fell into the rabbit hole of dynamic microphones and audio interfaces.

Dynamic microphones have been a game-changer because they reject background noise and make your voice sound clear and rich, even in an untreated room. My first big purchase was the **Shure MV7**, and I still remember colleagues saying, "Whoa, you sound like you‚Äôre podcasting."

Now I rotate through a few high-quality mics depending on the situation, and the difference is night and day compared to laptop audio. Sure, Apple‚Äôs built-in microphones have improved a lot, but nothing beats the quality of a good dedicated mic.

## 5. Small Investments, Big Returns

Each upgrade I made, like the desk, the chair, the lighting, and the audio setup, didn‚Äôt just improve my setup. They improved how people perceive me during meetings and how I perceive myself during work. Remote work can sometimes feel isolating, but creating a comfortable, professional environment goes a long way toward boosting focus and confidence.

## Final Thoughts

Six years of remote work taught me that productivity doesn‚Äôt just happen by accident. It‚Äôs the result of intentional choices: carving out a dedicated workspace, upgrading the tools you use every day, and finding little ways to make virtual collaboration feel less... virtual.

Remote work isn‚Äôt perfect, but with the right setup and mindset, it can be incredibly rewarding.
