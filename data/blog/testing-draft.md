Test draftFor 2026, I planned on writing more. Last year I wrote about 12 posts, which actually was more than I expected!

I wanted to improve my cadence because writing gives me clarity. It helps me externalize my thoughts which is important because the longer they stay internal, the more noise it creates for me and the less focus I become. It also serves as a nice history of my progress in what I am learning as I continue my career and navigate through a changing landscape in tech.
