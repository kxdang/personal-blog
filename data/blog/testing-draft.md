I've been wanting to improve my blogging habits this year, and writing more consistently has always helped me clarify my thoughts, reduce mental clutter, and gain clarity on my ideas. Even though I'm sharing my thoughts publicly, it's ultimately a personal exercise in reflection and self-improvement.

By journaling out loud, I can track my progress, identify areas for growth, and reflect on how far I've come. Plus, using automation to streamline my writing process is a key part of this goal.

To reduce the friction between idea generation and publication, I used to write in Google Docs first and then paste it into my blog repository. However, I wanted a more efficient way to draft and publish content without the hassle of copying and pasting.

After researching various Content Management Systems (CMSs), I settled on TinaCMS. While Gemini mentioned a few other options, TinaCMS's simplicity, Markdown support, and ability to preserve MDX files made it the perfect fit for my needs.

So far, using TinaCMS has been a game-changer. I can save drafts, write and publish posts seamlessly, and even reuse React components manually if needed.

With TinaCMS in place, I'm excited to see my blog come alive with more frequent posts. The reduced friction has been a welcome relief, and I'm looking forward to continuing this journey of more blogging.
