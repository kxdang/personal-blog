summary: Hot take. My blog. My thoughts. On the internet it goes.

There, I said it. It's a hot take I personally think is true.

Not because I love work. Not because I hate rest. But because weekdays move.

Packages get scanned. Projects advance. Systems update. Every weekday that passes feels like something is getting closer, even if it is just a box slowly making its way to my front door. I check tracking updates more often than I would like to admit, as if my attention alone might speed the truck up.

Weekends, by comparison, feel paused. The world holds its breath. And lately, that pause does not feel as freeing as it used to.

Lately, part of this comes from a simple change. I now work weekends too. Especially with a second job, weekends stopped being a finish line. They became just another day on the calendar, except one where less happens. No deliveries move. No email replies. Progress feels muted.

So I stopped looking forward to weekends themselves.

Instead, I look forward to events.

A planned dinner. Time with friends. A family gathering. Something intentional on the calendar that clearly interrupts the flow of ordinary days. Those moments feel like real breaks now, not because they are longer, but because they are deliberate.

Weekends did not lose their value. They just stopped being special by default. Rest, for me now, comes from intention, not from the name of the day.
